Welcome to my C Showcase repository! This collection of C projects is designed to demonstrate my proficiency and experience with the C programming language, Makefiles, and Dockerfiles. Each project showcases different aspects of C development, including algorithm implementation, use of multiple data structures, memory allocation, and more.
